We build a model to predict how likely an average player is to successfully perform the action of their choice. Think of it as having an xWhateverTheyAreDoing model. Next we use it for the actions of these players when they were under pressure. By comparing how often specific players executed an action successfully compared to the model estimated probabilities of them executing their actions successfully, we can find out players that are good at escaping pressures, and so on.
