- To decongest the main roads which are choked to a breaking point. 
- To provide the citizens with an alternative means of transport which is faster and more comfortable than the current options. 
- To check air pollution's threat to the well-being of the citizens 
- To gradually reduce the city's dependence on diesel supply.
