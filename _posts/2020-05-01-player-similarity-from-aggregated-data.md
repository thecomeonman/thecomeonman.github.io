Built a model to identify players with similar or better profiles. Built an interactive visualisation around it to understand various aspects of the player better. [Original post here](https://thecomeonman.github.io/PlayerSimilarityFromAggregatedData).
in which I analyse multiple players amongst the transfer rumours at the point and anecdotally validate the model with some of the results that show up, eg. Fernandinho's list has pretty much every player whom Guardiola has either played in the same position earlier or was rumoured to be interested in buying - Alcantara, Jorginho, Busquets, and Rodri, amongst others who have similar playing styles. 

I also posted [this Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/thecomeonman/status/1306654311661760512) for some transfers during the summer transfer window of 2020.

I also posted my attempt at finding replacements for Messi and Suarez [here](https://github.com/thecomeonman/Replacing-Suarez-and-Messi) around the 2020 summer transfer window. Of course, Dybala came on that list -
