Built a model to identify similar player or team styles depending on the way passes are made and received.

Amongst other things, I used it to [evaluate whether Liverpool choosing to practice against Benfica for their UCL 2019 final against Spurs made sense](https://thecomeonman.github.io/SpursBenficaSimilarityByLiverpool). The same method can be extended to compare and identify similar playing styles for any other team.

Some other applications of this model:
- [Deriving player roles](https://thecomeonman.github.io/SpatialSimilaritiesBetweenPlayers/PlayerRoles)
- [Finding players in similar roles - detailed version](https://thecomeonman.github.io/SpatialSimilaritiesBetweenPlayers/SimilarPlayers.html)
- [Finding players in similar roles - short version](https://thecomeonman.github.io/SpatialSimilaritiesBetweenPlayers/TeamHighLevel201819/ManCity.html)
