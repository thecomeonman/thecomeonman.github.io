### [Clustering using recursive division](https://github.com/thecomeonman/CURD)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thecomeonman/CURD/master/CURD_files/figure-markdown_strict/ResultsExploration00-1.png)

We consider the problem of clustering categorical datasets, with a view to arrive at simple, easily interpretable clusters. We propose CURD, a recursive partitioning algorithm that expresses clusters as leaf nodes of a decision tree.
