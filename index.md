## Football models

### [Defensive interactions from tracking data](https://thecomeonman.github.io/DefensiveInteractionsFromTrackingData/)

Building on top of the Friends of Tracking pitch control model to measure interactions betwee players of opposite teams

Methodology and example code included.


### xPo: a framework to value football actions

An event value measurement framework which won an honourable mention at the Seattle Sounders Analytics Competition 2020

- [A post explaining how it works](https://thecomeonman.github.io/xPo)
- [A dashboard which you could use to analyse a team](https://thecomeonman.github.io/xPoDashboard)

Methodology and example code included.


### [Player similarity / replacement based on aggregated match level data](https://thecomeonman.github.io/PlayerSimilarityFromAggregatedData)

Includes an interactive visualisation to understand various aspects of the player better


### [Playing style similarity based on spatial data from passes](https://thecomeonman.github.io/SpatialSimilaritiesBetweenPlayers)

Identifying similar player styles depending on the way players receive passes and make passes.

Some other applications of this model:

### [Clustering using recursive division](https://github.com/thecomeonman/CURD)

We consider the problem of clustering categorical datasets, with a view to arrive at simple, easily interpretable clusters. We propose CURD, a recursive partitioning algorithm that expresses clusters as leaf nodes of a decision tree.
