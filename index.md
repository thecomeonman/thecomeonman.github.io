## Clustering using recursive division, 2018-19

We consider the problem of clustering categorical datasets, with a view to arrive at simple, easily interpretable clusters. We propose CURD, a recursive partitioning algorithm that expresses clusters as leaf nodes of a decision tree. 

Demo: https://github.com/thecomeonman/CURD
