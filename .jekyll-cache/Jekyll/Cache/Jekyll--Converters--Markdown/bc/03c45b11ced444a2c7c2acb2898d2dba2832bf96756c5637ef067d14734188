Hello. I'm a data scientist with over ten years of experience working on a wide variety of problems, domains, environments, and with teams and clients from across the world. I also know some other tech and programming but not enough to figure out how to get the footer to stick to the bottom of this page.

<p>
This website lists things that have kept me busy. And the footer, of course. Here's <a href="https://thecomeonman.github.io/categories">a good place to get started</a> with all that's there here.
